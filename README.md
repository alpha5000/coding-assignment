# DevOps Engineer Coding Assignment

## About the application
Build an application for scheduling the bug engineer for the week.

The bug engineer will be the primary contact during that week for bug reports.

### Application requirements
- Create a schedule based on the names provided in `engineers.yml`
- The bug engineer will be reponsible for a week
- An engineer will be able to switch schedules with another engineer
- The app will have a web interface that you can see who is the bug engineer for the week and who are the bug engineers scheduled for the current and the next month
  + **Recommendation:** Having a calendar like UI would be nice
- Please take into considerations of holidays (U.S. National holidays will be enough) and don't have the engineers on those days

####  Note:
Requirements are designed to be vague, and while it's good to ask questions to clarify on requirements, for this coding challenge, we want to see how you are going to design the system so we will not be accepting questions regarding detailed requirement specifications. However, You are welcome to state in your documentations why you designed the system the way you did.

### Task specific requirements
- Please use a Ruby web framework
- Please have an architecture design of the app ready before you implement it
  + __Architecture design:__ e.g. How models (or components) will be interacting with each other
  + Have a screenshot or picture of it will be fine and upload it with the app
- Please have automated tests, minimum unit tests (integration tests will be a plus)
- Please have the code publically accessible (e.g. on GitHub) and have the source code under version control
- Please provide documentation of the following
  + How to get the app running locally
  + How to run the tests
  + How to use the app

#### Optional
- Deploy the app and have it publically accessible in case the instruction for running the app locally doesn't work

### Time limit
There will be no hard deadlines. However, if you don't hand in the assignment in about a week, you usually won't hand it in so you can think of an implicit deadline of a week.

### Handing in the assignment
Please send an email to jobs@cerego.com with the title `DevOps coding assignment` with your
- Name
- Resume
- A link to your source code (and the hosted app if deployed)


Thank you for your interest.
